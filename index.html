    <h1>Am I Online?</h1>
    <p>This is a very simple service for checking if your application has access
    to the internet.</p>
    <p>You use this by sending a GET request to <code>https://amionline.80x24.ca/UUID</code>, where UUID is whatever string you want, and then checking that the response is that exact same string.</p>
